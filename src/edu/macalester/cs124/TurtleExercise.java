    /**
     * For this in-class demo:
     *
     * 1. Set a breakpoint where sally is created and run in debugger.
     *
     *    Watch turtle objects respond to each message in turn.
     *
     * 2. Reorder lines (cmd-opt-up/down) so that fred is instantiated
     *    and added right after sally, and then their lines are
     *    interspersed â€” but each turtle's lines are still in their
     *    original order.
     *
     *    Discuss: Will it change the result?
     *
     *    Watch in the debugger.
     *
     * 3. After both turtles are added but before any draw commands, add:
     *
     *      fred = sally;
     *
     *    Discuss: What might happen? Brainstorm possible outcomes. (I can
     *    think of at least 5 reasonable-for-a-beginner guesses.) Discuss
     *    what each possible outcome would mean.
     *
     *    Take a class vote!
     *
     *    Moment of truth: watch in the debugger.
     *
     * 4. Bonus exercise: port this lib to Swift, make Turtle a struct
     *    instead of a class, and try #3 again.
